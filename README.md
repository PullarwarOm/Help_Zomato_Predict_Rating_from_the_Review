# Help-Zomato-Predict-Rating-from-the-Review
 Using NLP and machine learning, make a model to predict the rating in a review  based on the content of the text review. This will help identify cases with a mismatch.

- Zomato is India’s largest platform for discovering restaurants and ordering food. It operates in India as well as a few cities internationally. Bangalore is one of the biggest customers and restaurant bases for Zomato with 4 to 5 million users using the platform each month. 
- Users on the platform can also post reviews of restaurants and provide a rating accompanying the review. The content in the reviews should ideally reflect the rating provided by the customer. In many cases, there is a mismatch, owing to multiple reasons, where the rating does not match the customer review. The reviews and rating match is very important as it builds customer trust on the platform and helps the user get an accurate picture of the restaurant. 
- Here, I am using NLP techniques in conjunction with machine learning models to predict the rating from the review text which will ensure the ratings reflect the reviews and that the reviews seem trustworthy to the customer.
